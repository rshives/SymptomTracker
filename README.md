# SymptomTracker

A web application to help my wife track her MS symptoms.
I am currently porting from a Python GAE applicaton to a modern SPA web applicaton. 

Frameworks and languages I'll be using are:
* HTML
* JavaScript
* CSS
* [AngularJS] (https://angularjs.org/)
* [Bootstrap] (http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [JasmineJS] (https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine)
